# LibreGraph

## What is LibreGraph?

LibreGraph was originally conceived as the Kopano RestAPI, but is now organized as an independent project to bring the benefits of a [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com/) based RestAPI to other projects.

The goal is to provide a compatible server side implementation of Microsoft Graph, so that applications already compatible with it can also talk to a LibreGraph backend with minimal changes.
