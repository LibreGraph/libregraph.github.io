# Join the discussion!

This project currently uses [Github discussions](https://github.com/LibreGraph/libregraph.github.io/discussions) for non realtime communication with interested developers and integrators.

For realtime discussion and short questions a [Matrix Community](https://matrix.to/#/+libregraph:matrix.org) exists.
